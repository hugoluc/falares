00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:05.839
I view Brazilian Portuguese
as being more unashamed.

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:11.592
There is no reason for this view.
Languages aren't pure.

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:13.714
They are intrinsically impure

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.664
and there is no reason
for Brazilians to speak

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:21.519
orthodox Portuguese.
There's no reason for that.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.826
If Brazilians free the
Portuguese they speak,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:29.009
they may be building

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:32.217
the opportunity for creating
Brazilian Portuguese.

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:34.427
That's another issue altogether, isn't it?

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.236
About Brazilian Portuguese, right?

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:41.708
Many linguists, sociolinguists
already make the point

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:46.117
that our Portuguese isn't the
European variant, from Portugal.

00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:47.498
It has never been.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.597
That was a myth, an invention

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.743
typical of a colonized country.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:59.893
Just as a counterpoint, in
Portugal, we tend to stick

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:06.099
closer, more strictly, as
if we were still clinging on to

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.582
to a structure...

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.140
I wouldn't say exactly that it is old,
but that it preserves

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:18.173
its key characteristics
at the highest degree.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.150
I wouldn't say that what
happens in Brazil is the opposite,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.165
but rather a little looser,

00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:28.755
and so its Portuguese is better
suited for our times today.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.072
It has a greater capacity
to incorporate words,

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:34.561
and even invent words.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:47.007
<i>The word "sobrancelha"
(eyebrow) always pops into my mind.</i>

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.742
<i>This word is perfect to me.</i>

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:52.646
<i>It shows that people associate it
with "sombra", shade,</i>

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.500
<i>or to shade something, in fact .</i>

00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:58.102
We say "sobrancelha" because we
think eyebrows act as shades for eyelashes.

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:01.888
It's an odd idea that
shows that we are

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:06.693
constantly pulling away from Latin, and
we no longer understand that "sobrancelha"

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.964
as coming from comes from supercilium,
Latin for above the lashes.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.668
With that distance we start
interpreting words differently,

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:17.751
and through these interpretations
words start taking on new forms

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.687
and also become new words...

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.142
I like that a lot.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:34.072
In English, you say:
"I work, you work, he works.

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:37.457
We work, you work, they work."

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.085
It's basically the same
as colloquial Portuguese!

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:44.742
"Eu trabalho, tu trabalha,
ele trabalha.

00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:47.829
Nós trabalha,
vocês trabalha, eles trabalha."

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.672
<i>It's the same structure.</i>

00:02:57.206 --> 00:03:00.160
<i>Why is English the
language of globalization?</i>

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:04.363
<i>It is the language of the intelligent,
of prestige.</i>

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:07.821
<i>And our colloquial Portuguese,
which is identical to English,</i>

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.634
<i>is the language
of the ignorant, the inferior.</i>

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.508
<i>It's pure prejudice.</i>

00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:19.633
But someone might say,
"No, that's just the nature of English."

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.214
No it isn't! It's false.

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:25.505
English had its own differences,
like standard Portuguese.

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:30.343
Those differences faded away
but that did not harm the language.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:42.355
<i>Languages change, transform,
but do not deteriorate,</i>

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.830
<i>since there is no such
thing as a worn out language.</i>

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:49.285
<i>So language offers us an opportunity</i>

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:55.435
<i>to learn and develop
our awareness of diversity.</i>

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:07.201 line:20%
<i>In fact, we want to keep speaking to</i>

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:13.365 line:20%
<i>and teaching our children - that's good.</i>

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.049 line:20%
<i>Even though it's good,</i>

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:21.531 line:20%
<i>the leaders of non-indigenous
people do not support us.</i>

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.996 line:20%
Why do they not support us?

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.841 line:20%
They don't say, "Take these things,"

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.112 line:20%
"We are non-indigenous people
and know how to do these things,

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.015 line:20%
that's why we are giving you gifts."

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.223 line:20%
"We are going to give you paper,
so you won't be kept from

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:53.467 line:20%
teaching your children and from
safeguarding your language."

00:04:54.368 --> 00:04:58.948 line:20%
The federal government
doesn't say that...

00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:01.998 line:20%
that's why we lack many things.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:09.368 line:20%
We are not poor, we just lack materials

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.739 line:20%
and paper to write.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.885 line:20%
We request these things,
but they don't give us an answer.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:24.226 line:20%
They are stingy, stingy with us

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.161 line:20%
because we are the other.

00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.304
