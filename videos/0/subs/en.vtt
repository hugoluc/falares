WEBVTT

00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:03.553
In our Yanomami forest...

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:09.223
there's no such thing as paper,

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:14.915
notebooks, pencils, pens,
erasers, blackboards...

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:21.221
We also don't know
how to make such things...

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:25.083
We know how to speak.

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:29.028
We talk, we chat,

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.876
we perform ceremonial dialogues,
shamanism.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:40.366
As if we were another species,
in another world,

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:45.037
The discourse, logic, perspective
of that human race

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.174
was so different from the one
that arrived

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.218
that for a long time there
really wasn't any dialogue.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.467
Some would speak Portuguese,

00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:58.906
and others would speak Tupi,
Krenak, Xavante, Yanomami,

00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:02.396
Pancararu, Kiriri,
Pataxó, Xucuru…

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.912
There were so many of different peoples,

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:13.687
that linguists say there were between
900 and 1,100 languages at the time;

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:18.009
as if you were in the woods
and started hearing

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.628
thrushes, great kiskadees,
chestnut-bellied seed finches, woodpeckers,

00:01:21.668 --> 00:01:25.332
all these different voices and sounds,

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:28.812
and you were trying to understand,
was this an orchestra

00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:33.927
or just cacophony?

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.243
In fact, in some native languages,

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:39.212
in some of the mother tongues
that have survived,

00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:42.903
some expressions are literally
the phonetic representation

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.471
of a bird's voice.

00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:02.988
BIRD TONGUE

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:07.861
Portuguese was imposed through domination

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.065
in the form of forced labor and
acculturation upon indigenous people

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.369
and enslaved Africans.

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:21.074
Since these individuals were
stripped of their culture

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.258
and their humanity,

00:02:25.298 --> 00:02:28.662
given that slaves were reduced
to the condition of chattels,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.597
they had no identity,

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:33.153
no family, no language.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.023
When you kill a culture,
you kill a people.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.071
Abdias do Nascimento
addressed this in his book

00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:39.539
<i>The Genocide of the Black Brazilian</i>.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.509
He said that genocide means
any type of annihilation,

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.666
be it political or cultural.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.068
When you kill a language,
you kill a people

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.170
you kill a culture, a people.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.241
This is precisely the very
violent process of colonization.

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:58.025
It uses violence to enforce,

00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:01.731
to legitimate the discourse
of the victor.

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:13.193
DOMINANT - LANGUAGES - DOMINATED

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:16.489 line:20%
I want to talk about difference,

00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:21.344 line:20%
and there's a dearth of information about
Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS).

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.613 line:20%
It's very complicated, since it is
overwhelmingly dominated by Portuguese

00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:30.767 line:20%
It's been many years in the making.

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:36.617 line:20%
We can also talk about
indigenous and racial issues,

00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:40.925 line:20%
all the particular aspects of languages
influenced by Portuguese.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:44.237
In the late 19th century,

00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:47.561
Brazil's ruling classes,

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.645
with their racist plans for
"whitening" the population,

00:03:52.297 --> 00:03:56.837
chose their default language,

00:03:56.922 --> 00:04:02.109
the standard for literary language,
their model language to be

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.336
Portuguese as is spoken in Portugal.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.415
This created a problem

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.251
that escalated over time.

00:04:11.743 --> 00:04:16.303
Even our own grammar books,
for example, say that

00:04:17.478 --> 00:04:22.696
an unstressed pronoun
should follow the verb.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.580
"Parece-ME que é assim."

00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:31.171
So the pronoun, ME, comes after
the verb, Parece: "Parece-ME."

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:38.044
But is this where we usually place
our pronouns in Brazilian Portuguese?

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:42.249
How do we actually say this sentence?
We say, "ME parece que não é assim."

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:48.688
I really love the journeys
words take over time.

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.004
I think that when
we adopt the mindset

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:52.987
that there is a standard
grammar, by the book or dictionary,

00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:56.163
we often blind ourselves
from seeing the beauty

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:58.465
of the new forms words take on.

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:02.774
As an example, I like to
compare the word "floresta."

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:06.219
We are so used to seeing
the word, "floresta," and

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.545
translating it into English as "forest,"
or Italian as "foresta," not caring that

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:14.548
that there is no "L" between the "F"
and the "O" in these target languages.

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.391
But that "L" is found in the Spanish and
Portuguese, because the Iberian Peninsula

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:21.240
and its languages underwent
semantic contamination.

00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.324
This contamination linked
the Vulgar Latin word "foresta,"

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.248
which predates "floresta,"
to the idea of a "flor" or flower.

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.965
People then imagined flowers in the
forest, so we started saying "floresta,"

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.669
So, a word transforms to reflect
its meaning, thus enriching the word

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.350
and makes that word unique

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.508
in comparison to its English
or Italian versions.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:46.746
It is barbaric and beautiful
at the same time. Precious.

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.247 line:20%
I teach LIBRAS
(Brazilian Sign Language)

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.164 line:20%
and I really notice the
transformation of our language.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.720 line:20%
For example,

00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:56.743 line:20%
There was a class

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.675 line:20%
where a deaf teacher had a brush
with student who could hear.

00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:06.697 line:20%
The teacher came to me and said,
"Oh, that hearing student is handful

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:10.718 line:20%
because she learned LIBRAS all wrong!"

00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:14.282 line:20%
I asked, "Oh really?
What sign did she use?"

00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:17.515 line:20%
The teacher answered
with the sign for "sweet."

00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:23.357 line:20%
When I saw that, it conjured up
fond memories of the old days!

00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:28.037 line:20%
Back in the day, this sign meant
"sweet" at schools for the deaf.

00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:32.006 line:20%
I asked the teacher,
"Is your student an older woman?"

00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:34.294 line:20%
She answered, "Yes, yes!"

00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:36.051 line:20%
So I went over and asked the student,

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:38.428 line:20%
"Who who taught you this sign?"

00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:40.930 line:20%
"Oh, what memories! That's the
sign for old, I'd almost forgotten it!"

00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.322 line:20%
That's just how she learned how to sign.

00:06:43.357 --> 00:06:45.659 line:20%
And today, we use the same sign for "sweet."

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.251 line:20%
The Brazilian Portuguese
is over 500 years old.

00:06:50.462 --> 00:06:54.325 line:20%
Brazilian sign language, LIBRAS, has
been around for 20 years... give or take.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.387 line:20%
So... from 2002 to now...

00:06:57.422 --> 00:07:00.424 line:20%
that's when it was legally recognized
and disseminated.

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.785 line:20%
Do you see the difference?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.286 line:20%
One has been around for 500 years,
the other for 20.

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:07.697 line:20%
We have a language that's been
around and recognized for 500 years,

00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:10.804 line:20%
and another that's 20 years
old and has just showed up!
