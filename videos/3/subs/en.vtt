00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:02.649
I notice people are so...

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:06.620
conditioned by mass culture that
when one different accent shows up,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.309
in a soap opera or such,
"What's that?"

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:13.447
How can you say that? You live in a country
the size of a continent.

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:18.031
There's a different accent
at each point in this entire structure.

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:21.239
And you think yours is the only
right way of speaking?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.550
I say <i>po/?/ta</i> (door),
and someone makes fun of me:

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.774
<i>"po/?/ta? Oh, no, it's po/r/ta".</i>

00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:31.190
Then I think to myself,
what does it matter to you

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.693
if my <i>porta</i> sounds
different from yours?

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.285
But it matters to me because
they are denying me my identity,

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.407
an identity that
I'm proud of.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.283
<i>If we consider the lexicon, there's
broad spectrum.</i>

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:54.922
<i>In the region of Amazonian speech,
for instance, the word peteca is used</i>

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.456
<i>for what we call glass marble.</i>

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.222
The word <i>bolita</i>

00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.028
ranges from Rio Grande do Sul
to Mato Grosso do Sul

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.496
to Mato Grosso.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.906
This is due to the influence
of Spanish, of course,

00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:08.635
as well as the gauchos who migrated
to the Central-West Region of Brazil.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:13.707
<i>There's marraio, cancão, burca, burquinha.</i>

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:18.579
<i>These are some of variants that exist
with a marked presence,</i>

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.783
<i>and widespread usage
in these regions.</i>

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.875 line:20%
We can identify the region
someone is from through contact:

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:36.557 line:20%
A deaf person may
start signing and I ask,

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:38.233 line:20%
"are you from Rio de Janeiro?"

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:39.657 line:20%
<i>"Yes!"</i>

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:43.157 line:20%
Accents allow us to recognize
where a speaker is from

00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:46.357 line:20%
Likewise, the hands of someone signing

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:48.716 line:20%
can show you where they are from.

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:50.657 line:20%
They have a different way of signing.

00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:54.657 line:20%
São Paulo has many dialects

00:01:54.957 --> 00:02:02.157 line:20%
because of regionalisms, family influence,
and the arrival of deaf people

00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:07.457 line:20%
from other regions like Bahia, Recife,
Minas, etc.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.559 line:20%
There was lots of blending.

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:16.207 line:20%
All of these are important factors
that influence language.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:22.157 line:20%
On top of that, there are minor
variations within each state

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:25.157 line:20%
and this is natural in language.

00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:28.181
For example: <i>menos</i> and
<i>menas</i> (variants of less).

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:32.819
We always point out that <i>menas</i> doesn't
exist. But it does. It's right there.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.892
In our survey of 1,100
participants, we found that

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.942
those whose highest level of
education was secondary

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:44.231
preferred to use the <i>menas</i> form

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:49.569
which is used in agreement with Portuguese
feminine nouns like <i>força, perda, alegria<i>

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.052
and those who had reached higher education

00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:55.275
preferred the standard rule,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.293
but we also found that some people
with higher education backgrounds

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.584
nonetheless continue using
the more popular form <i>menas</i>.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.491
We often like to hold out, don't we?
Like we do when we say <i>menas</i>.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:15.962
<i>Menas</i> has became the paradigmatic
example of incorrect speech,

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:20.100
but it's simply brilliant that an adverb
could take on gender in Portuguese.

00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:26.373
This word is unbelievable, <i>menas</i>.
We've added gender to an adverb.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:31.578
This shows the new ways in which we're
dealing with the living, spoken language.

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:35.082
The sheer proliferation and
repetition of <i>menas</i> shows

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:39.519
that it is not just half a dozen people.
No, it's gaining traction.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.289
Perhaps one day it'll even be
included in normative grammar.

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:43.724
It's fun!

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.632
<i>No one can halt language. No one.</i>

00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:57.904
<i>Language belongs to the people
and the people dictate the rules.</i>

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.847
The most beautiful word is <i>borogodó</i>.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.249
<i>Borogodó</i> is a word that...

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.799
even hides a secret

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.355
because in Portugal
nobody understands it.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:20.160
People don't know it.
So, I really like it.

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:26.646
It's a conceptual contribution,

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:30.998
it's not just the form; it's not like
saying <i>ita</i> for stone,

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.607
it's something else,
something that did not exist before

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:38.011
and that the original peoples
have offered us,

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.747
they have offered us an idea that we
did not have.

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:44.631
Diversity in unity,
unity in diversity.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:49.589
There are two forces that
command language, its usage.

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:54.361
A centrifugal force, that is,
that moves toward diversity,

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:58.765
and another centripetal force,
that moves toward unity.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.148
These two forces interact with one another.

00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:05.505
On the one hand, there's the school
defends unity.

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:10.357
On the other hand, there's the people,
the individual,

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:14.781
who struggles for diversity,
exposing their own diversity.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:20.387
One of the great assets of
Brazilian Portuguese

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:23.603
is that it tends to be witty,

00:05:23.643 --> 00:05:26.927
it is inclined to being pretty, cheerful,

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.162
genial, humorous.

00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:37.029
This injection of high spirits

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.557
into the Portuguese language
is extremely valuable.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.679
Someday it may even heal
Portuguese melancholy...

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:49.996
if we traveled more,

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:53.820
and were open to more
contamination, more mixing.
