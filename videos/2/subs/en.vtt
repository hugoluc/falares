00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:06.379
There's this myth, so to speak, that
there is a sole language in Brazil, right?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.022
And that there's only one
proper way of speaking it.

00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:13.447
This view has been really challenged.

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:18.332
For some time now there are studies

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.814
and authors who focus on this.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.451
We know that our country is multilingual

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.028
just as we are multicultural.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:32.029
We speak Portuguese,
the majority language...

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.967
we also have the minority
languages of immigrants,

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.253
those of the indigenous peoples,
the many

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:42.923
many indigenous groups,
but there's some unity;

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:44.978
we speak Portuguese,

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.582
but it is quite diversified
throughout Brazil.

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:54.688
As the great Portuguese author and
Nobel Laureate in Literature

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.325
José Saramago said, instead of
referring to the Portuguese language

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.827
it would be more accurate to
refer to Portuguese languages.

00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:28.865
PORTUGUESE LANGUAGES?

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:33.226
<i>This diversity is reflected
at every level of language,</i>

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.896
<i>starting with phonetics, the sounds.</i>

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.002
There's the countryside retroflex r (?):
<i>ho/?/ta</i> (garden), <i>ve/?/de</i> (green)...

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:49.201
which was disseminated
by the <i>bandeirantes</i>, for sure.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.445
Because ever since the
São Vicente settlement,

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.982
and the contact with the indigenous
people in those territories

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:59.453
and the Portuguese men
interbreeding with Indigenous women.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:04.925
Their children spoke
an intermediary language,

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:09.463
it was the common language, but they
also learned a modified Portuguese,

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:12.332
a type of Portuguese that was not the same

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.235
as the one brought from Portugal.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.684
And if you think in historical terms,

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:22.209
the whole question of right or
wrong is quite relative, isn't it?

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.592
If you go back to the 16th century
and look at texts by Camões

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:30.897
he uses <i>alembrar</i> (remember) just as it
is used in by Brazil's country bumpkins;

00:02:30.937 --> 00:02:33.787
So, it's cool to think that Camões

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:37.557
used <i>alembrar</i> and a hillbilly
uses it too. Why is that?

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:42.643
Because rural speech
is called archaized speech,

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:47.948
but archaic in the sense that
it is less influenced by...

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:52.739
by the many ways
of speaking in the cities.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.410
Big cities have many ways of speaking,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.146
which are influenced by
many factors, the media, etc.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:04.618
The speech of people
in more remote places is

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.187
better preserved, if you will.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.491
We also have syllables
ending in "s":

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.921
One region says <i>fe/sh/ta</i> (party)
and another says <i>fe/s/ta</i> (party).

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:23.170
About the <i>fe/sh/ta</i> region: where does the
fricative, or palatalized /sh/ (?) from?

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.808
This /sh/ arrived with the Portuguese,
in 1808, when Dom João VI

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:33.747
came to Rio de Janeiro.
So this way of speaking was prestigious.

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:38.085
Speech in São Paulo was not prestigious;
it was discriminated against.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:42.556
So this prestigious /sh/ spread across
almost all of Brazil.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:56.436
<i>Communication, to me,
is a way of life.</i>

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:02.042
<i>Language is a expression
of your identity, of what you like,</i>

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:06.279
who you are, your origins. That's why
I think it's so important for us

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:10.717
to better understand what accents are
and be proud of them.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.227
<i>Language enables us to live in society.</i>

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:27.705
It enables communication,

00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:31.621
 interaction between individuals.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.458
That's what language is.

00:04:35.193 --> 00:04:39.518 line:20%
Especially for deaf people, the body

00:04:39.618 --> 00:04:43.348 line:20%
is a form of communicating
with anyone else.

00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:48.570 line:20%
The body talks.
It displays and expresses itself!

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.462 line:20%
It's different from the voice.

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:56.072 line:20%
It's different. We know we have a voice,
sign language also has a voice

00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:57.787 line:20%
but...

00:04:57.887 --> 00:05:01.015 line:20%
expression goes way beyond

00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:04.244 line:20%
through its visual
and communicational aspects.

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:06.437 line:20%
Anywhere you go and do this, look.
